Challenge 1

A 3-tier environment is a common setup. Use a tool of your choosing/familiarity create these
resources. Please remember we will not be judged on the outcome but more focusing on the
approach, style and reproducibility.

Approach :

Starting from the left, I will be desiging the infrastuture with one VPC with 4 subnets with combination of private and public for various layers. In addition to that there will be a bastion host and a NAT gateway for the admins to have access to the infrastructure. I am also going to create a Auto scaling group across two availbality zones for fault tolerance and high availablity.

What we need :

1. VPC
2. Internet gateway
3. 4 Subnets (2 public and 2 private in 2 AZ's)
4. Create two Route tables (public for internet and private for the traffic through NAT Gateway)
5. Create NAT Gateway
6. ELB
7. Auto Scaling group
8 Bastion Host
